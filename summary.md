# Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models
Published in 07/18/2023, 14:31:57
## Summary
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and
fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70
billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for
dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most
benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and
safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a
detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of
Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and
contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.

## Summary
- We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from
7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that
it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available
datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible
datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks,
and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and
PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community.
